### 3. The population of a community in 1970 was 48,000 people and in 1990 it was 64,000 people

#### a) Write a formula for the population of the community t years after 1970

- $64,000=48,000e^{k20}$
- $1.33=e^{20t}$
- $\ln(1.33)=20k$
- $k=\frac{\ln(1.33)}{20}$
- $P(t)=48,000e^{0.0143t}$

#### b) Estimate the population in the year 2000

- $P(30)=48,000e^{0.0143(30)}$
- $73,715 \space\textrm{people}$

#### c) Approximately when will the population be 100,000?

- $100,000=48,000e^{0.0143t}$
- $2.083=e^{0.0143t}$
- $\ln(2.083)=0.0143t$
- $\frac{\ln(2.083)}{0.0143}=t$
- $t = 51.31 \space\textrm{years or mid 2021}$

#### d) What is the doubling time of the population of this community?

- $2=e^{0.0143t}$
- $\ln(2)=0.0143t$
- $\frac{\ln(2)}{0.0143}=t$
- $t = 48.47 \space\textrm{years}$

### 4. The population of a community in 1970 was 40,000 people and in 1990 it was 60,000 people

#### a) Write a formula for the population of the community t years after 1970

- $60,000=40,000e^{k20}$
- $1.5=e^{20t}$
- $\ln(1.5)=20k$
- $k=\frac{\ln(1.5)}{20}$
- $P(t)=40,000e^{0.0203t}$

#### b) Estimate the population in the year 2000

- $P(30)=40,000e^{0.0203(30)}$
- $73,543 \space\textrm{people}$

#### c) Approximately when will the population be 100,000?

- $100,000=40,000e^{0.0203t}$
- $2.5=e^{0.0203t}$
- $\ln(2.5)=0.0203t$
- $\frac{\ln(2.5)}{0.0203}=t$
- $t = 45.14 \space\textrm{years or mid 2015}$

#### d) What is the doubling time of the population of this community?

- $2=e^{0.0203t}$
- $\ln(2)=0.0203t$
- $\frac{\ln(2)}{0.0203}=t$
- $t = 34.15 \space\textrm{years}$

### 17. We started an experiment with 10 grams of a radioactive material and 14 days later there were 2 grams left

#### a) Find an equation for the amount of material remaining t days after the beginning of the experiment

- $2=10e^{k14}$
- $0.2=e^{k14}$
- $\ln(0.2)=k14$
- $\frac{\ln(0.2)}{14}=k$
- $k=-0.115$
- $D(t)=10e^{-0.115t}$

#### b) Find the half–life of the material

- $5=10e^{-0.115t}$
- $0.5=e^{-0.115t}$
- $\ln(0.5)=-0.115t$
- $\frac{\ln(0.5)}{-0.115}=t$
- $t = 6.03 \space \textrm{days}$

#### c) How long after the beginning of the experiment will there be 0.7 grams of the material left?

- $0.7=10e^{-0.115t}$
- $0.07=e^{-0.115t}$
- $\ln(0.07)=-0.115t$
- $\frac{\ln(0.07)}{-0.115}=t$
- $t = 23.12 \space \textrm{days}$

### 18. We start with 8 mg of a radioactive substance and 10 days later determine that there is 6.3 mg of the substance left

#### a) Find an equation for the amount left t days after the start

- $6.3=8e^{k10}$
- $0.788=e^{k10}$
- $\ln(0.788)=k10$
- $\frac{\ln(0.788)}{10}=k$
- $k=-0.0238$
- $D(t)=8e^{-0.0238t}$

#### b) Find the half–life of the material

- $4=8e^{-0.0238t}$
- $0.5=e^{-0.0238t}$
- $\ln(0.5)=-0.0238t$
- $\frac{\ln(0.5)}{-0.0238}=t$
- $t = 29.12 \space \textrm{days}$

#### c) How long after the start will there be one milligram of the substance left?

- $1=8e^{-0.0238t}$
- $0.125=e^{-0.0238t}$
- $\ln(0.125)=-0.0238t$
- $\frac{\ln(0.125)}{-0.0238}=t$
- $t = 87.37 \space \textrm{days}$
